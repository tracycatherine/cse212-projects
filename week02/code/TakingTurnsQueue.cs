/// This queue is circular.  When people are added via AddPerson, then they are added to the 
/// back of the queue (per FIFO rules).  When GetNextPerson is called, the next person
/// in the queue is saved to be returned and then they are placed back into the back of the queue.  Thus,
/// each person stays in the queue and is given turns.  When a person is added to the queue, 
/// a turns parameter is provided to identify how many turns they will be given.  If the turns is 0 or
/// less than they will stay in the queue forever.  If a person is out of turns then they will 
/// not be added back into the queue.
